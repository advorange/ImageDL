# ImageDL
Mass download images from websites and compare for duplicates.

The image comparer database is a LiteDB database. There should not be any reason to edit the database, but if you need to, the password is "123".
Right now there is only a Windows version, but any other operating system that supports .Net Core/Standard only needs an implementation of the picture bool hashing.

**Currently supports:**
* 4chan
* Anime-Pictures
* Artstation
* DeviantArt
* Eshuushuu
* Imgur
* Instagram (likely to have breaking changes in their API soon)
* Moebooru
  * Danbooru
  * Gelbooru
  * Konachan
  * Safebooru
  * Yandere
* Pixiv
* Reddit
* Tumblr
* Twitter
* Vsco

*This program is not in any way affiliated with any of the above services.*
