# ImageDL
Mass download images from websites and compare for duplicates.

Currently there is only a Windows implementation, but any other operating system that supports .Net Core/Standard only needs the method that generates the brightness hash of pixels to work.

**Currently supports:**
* 4chan
* anime-pictures
* Artstation
* DeviantArt
* Eshuushuu (slow)
* Imgur
* Instagram (likely to have breaking changes in their API soon)
* Moebooru
  * Danbooru
  * Gelbooru
  * Konachan
  * Safebooru
  * Yandere
* Reddit
* Tumblr
* Vsco

*This program is not in any way affiliated with any of the above services.*
